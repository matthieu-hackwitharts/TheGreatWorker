# TheGreatWorker
A multiprocessing based Linux Enum script

TheGreatWorker is a Linux enumeration script written in Python3 and based on multiprocessing, which guarantees its execution speed.

Usage :

TheGreatWorker.py -[option 1] (argument1) -[option 2] (argument2)

Two main options :

--help or -h (joke, it's not a real option but you can use it as you want)

--output or -o : Save script output to a file by specify a location, highly recommended because of the lack of screen space.

--password or -p : Use a given password to run sudo permissions,if not, the script will not return the result of this command.


Note : Multiprocessing can cause "phantom" execution traces after the program is stopped, if this is the case do not hesitate to repeat Ctrl+c to stop it definitively.


Have fun and good hacking !
